It helps run to custom commands from bash, is able to control your service from console like the think client does.
Main parts of the project:
* [String parser](https://github.com/vlikin/console/wiki/String-parser)
* Command manager
* [Console runner](https://github.com/vlikin/console/wiki/Console-command-manager-implementation)

It manages console commands. It uses own string parser that can be used independently.
